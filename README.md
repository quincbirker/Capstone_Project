## Project Idea: Book Recommender 

### Problem Area

Have you ever read a book that wasn’t that great? I find that when this happens, it’s difficult to go out and get a new book. The problem that this project aims to solve is giving readers recommendations on books that they will actually enjoy so they go out and buy more books. 

### The User

Anyone looking to find a new book to read that wants a personalized recommendation based on their liking.

Bookstores can use this book recommender to get customers to buy more books as well. The more people enjoy their last book, the more likely they are to keep reading and buying more books.  

### Big Idea

Someone will be able to input previous book titles that they have liked in the past and the model will return book suggestions for future reads.

### Impact

This project aims to give people more incentive to pick up a book and start reading. It can be daunting to go out and purchase a book when you have no idea if you will like it or not. I want to give readers a personalized recommendation so that they can easily find a book that they will enjoy. 
From my own experience, I’m picky with what books. If I read a book that I don’t enjoy, I tend to give up on reading altogether and it can take months before I look for another book to read. By the end of this project, I hope to assist in someone's reading journey and get them hooked on books.

### Alternative Idea: Predicting Consumer Spending

### Problem area

My area of interest is in consumer behaviour and understanding human behavioural patterns. I think it’s very interesting to use real data to analyze purchasing habits. This project has the opportunity to understand customer purchasing trends to make better marketing decisions and financial forecasting.

### The User

A retail business that is looking for marketing insights on current and future clients.

### Big Idea

Predicting consumer spending: 
How to predict how much a customer will spend based on their recent activity
How to predict spending based on special offers, free shipping, product pricing
Does gender play a role in how much a person is likely to spend?
How other people have approached this problem:

### Impact

By predicting consumer spending, businesses can make more curated marketing plans and more accurate revenue forecasting. Overall, the problem this project is trying to solve will help increase profits for a business.
